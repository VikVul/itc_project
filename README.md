# itc_project
Hey
So as you know im still pursuing my bachelor. and I took 'Machine Learning' course this semester
apperantly a week ago we started the 'decision tree' topic ><
so i learn it on the go, thanks to this project
it was quite hard, and i didnt have the time to finish it proparly :\
this was my first time with catigorical data analysis..imagine the shock
but i did my best. so i hope you'll appreciate my afforts

for data enrichment - i wrote 'utc us state offset' file by myself
cuz i didnt find anywere on the net (apparently there are states with several utc offsets, so state informations isnt enough to decide local offsets)
so i calculated the avarage offset. think its fine.

i had enormous problems with memory and sklearn dic. 
during this project i re-installed python, gave up on pyCharm and installed ANACONDA
also i had bunch of memory errors- so I shrink the data - i know i done it poorly. 
but due to time-limits i had - this was my only option
(so dont judge me so hard on this)
i tried to fix it, but i didnt have the time to use 'chunks' or explore other solutions

in the end - i have to say i did enjoy the task. and i learn a LOT
and thanks to it im now sure 100% this is it.
love it. :) so please be gentle with me..
hope to see you soon at that interview
bye!
